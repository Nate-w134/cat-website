                Cats make great pets, as they can be kept inside, they clean up after themselves, are often already house-trained as kittens, and they love a knee to curl up on in winter.
                
                Cats are also great communicators as they can use different pitches in their meows to get their message across. This can be “I’m hungry” or “Hey, look at me!”. A cat will use different tones for each feeling to speak with their owner.
                
                Cats are also more independent than dogs and don’t require as much attention, such as the need to be taken out for daily walks. 
                
                Below are some pros and cons of keeping a cat:
                
                Pros:
                
                Easily house trained with a litter box.
                A self-cleaning pet: cats are constantly bathing themselves.
                Cat food is generally cheaper than dog food.
                Independent and able to entertain themselves.
                Less expensive to take to the vet and for boarding at a cattery if you're going away.
                Cats are very calming and can relieve anxiety.
                 
                
                Cons:
                
                A little harder to train to obey commands.
                Can be a bit aloof.
                Tend to enjoy scratching furniture.
                Can give some people allergies.
                Don’t cope well with travelling or moving house.
